## Review: Tables in R

Recall, we are interested in exploring the properties of *samples* composed of *observations*. Each unit has several *variables* measured and recorded. We organize these data in a table with the *observations on the rows* and the *variables on the columns*.

Example:

```{r}
diamonds
```


## Graphing and Plotting

**Graphing** or **plotting** is the representation of data in a visual form, typically on a 2D plane.

Humans have a wonderful ability to process visual stimuli quickly.

Great for displaying large data sets that might be difficult to describe and finding relationships between variables.

## Plotting ain't easy

* What exactly can we put in a plot?
* How to connect the plot to data?
* What are our goals for the plot?
* What additional information is necessary to understand the plot?

## The Semiology of Graphics

In 1967, **Jacques Bertin** published the *Semiology of Graphics* to describe common elements of plots and what they could achieve.

Bertin described two ways of thinking about plots:

1. Visual ("retinal") variables: connections between objects in the plot and underlying data
2. Relationship what types of relationships can the visual variables express

## Visual variables/retinal variables:

* Position/planar dimensions
* Size (small to large)
* Value (light to dark)
* Texture (pattern)
* Color (discrete or continuously varying)
* Orientation (angle/rotation)
* Shape (usually distinct shapes)

## Relationships

* Selection: find groups that are the same
* Association: find units in different groups that share qualities
* Order: natural sequence in the variable
* Quantitative: read relative differences as actual changes in data

## The Grammar of Graphics and `ggplot`

A follow up to Bertin's work was *The Grammar of Graphics* by Leland Wilkinson.
This book described a programming language for graphics based on ideas in
Bertin's system.

The GoG was implemented for R in `ggplot` (and later replaced by `ggplot2`). (See
the GGPlot Book on Canvas for more details.)

## The components of a ggplot graph

* The graph object itself (creating using `ggplot(data)`)
* A set of *aesthetic* mappings (connecting data to visual variables)
* Layers: collections of geometric elements (`geom_*()`) and statistical transformations (`stat_*()`)
* Scales: information on the range or composition of variables
* Coordinate systems: how the data are arranged spatially
* Facet: breaking a single plot into many, similar plots
* Theme: all the other color and printing aspects of the plot

## Creating a ggplot

Start use the `ggplot` function to start our plot
```{r}
efficiency <- ggplot(data = mpg)
class(efficiency)
efficiency # for now, blank
```

## Connecting columns to visual variables

What can we plot?
```{r}
colnames(mpg)
```

"Aesthetic" mappings connect columns to visual variables
```{r}
efficiency <- ggplot(data = mpg,
                     aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))
```

## Geometries: objects on the plot

In the previous we connected visual variables to columns, now we need to explain how to display them.

We will use a **geometry function** (have the form `geom_TYPE()`).

```{r}
efficiency + geom_point()
```

## Alternative form

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))
```

## Exercise: Great Lakes water levels

Here's a data set from the US Army Corps of Engineers showing the height of the Great Lakes (with Michigan and Huron being one body) above sea level, aggregated the median height for each year.

```{r}
glwl <- read_csv("data/GLHYD_data_english_cleaned.csv.gz") |>
  group_by(body, year) |> summarize(ht = median(height_ft)) |> ungroup()
glwl
```

Use this data set to make a scatter plot of the height of each lake in each year, colored by which `body` the reading is from.

```{r glwl-plot-setup}

glwl <- read_csv("data/GLHYD_data_english_cleaned.csv.gz") |>
  group_by(body, year) |> summarize(ht = median(height_ft)) |> ungroup()
```

```{r glwl-plot, exercise = TRUE}
```

```{r glwl-solution}
ggplot(glwl, aes(x = year, y = ht, color = body)) + geom_point()
ggplot(glwl, aes(x = year, y = ht, color = body)) + geom_line()
```


Improve your plot by changing it to a `geom_line()`

## What aesthetic mappings can I use?

Let's visit the docs: [`geom_point`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html)

## Trying out some other mappings

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
           size = cyl,
           color = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Logical variables

In R, when we evaluate if something is true or false, we get two special values:

```{r}
# notice the capitals
TRUE
FALSE
```

Logicals are generated anywhere we can compare two vectors:

```{r}
x <- 1:5
x < 7
x <= 3

y <- c(0, 3, 4, -1, 2)

x < y
```

## Using expressions

We can also use expressions involving columns.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
           shape = year > 2000)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Overriding parameters for all points

We can pass in constants that apply to all points (size and transparency):

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
           shape = year > 2000)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.5)
```

## Jitter: useful noise

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```


## Trend lines

When using scatter plots, one of the most common summaries is a **trend line**.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_smooth() # notice multiple geometries!
```

## Exercise

Use the `faitful` (eruptions at Old Faithful in Yellowstone) data set to create a scatter plot of `eruprtions` vs. `waiting` with a trend line. Color the points if the waiting time exceeds 70.

```{r mpg-trendline, exercise = TRUE}

```
