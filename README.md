# Stats 306, Winter 2024, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

A more detailed description of the course, policies, and available materials can
be found on our Canvas page (requires enrollment in the course).

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to computation and programming
for Statistics and Data Science majors. Students will learn how to load and
manipulate data, explore and visualize data, and design and implement algorithms
for statistical analysis. Students will learn to use the R programming language,
along with useful packages for data manipulation and visualization. We will also
emphasize the skills and techniques required for team based collaboration in
research and industry.

## Instructors

* Lead Instructor: Mark Fredrickson (mfredric@umich.edu)
* GSIs: 

## Software

### R and Posit Cloud

We will use the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org) and the [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) (formerly RStudio Cloud). 
For details on how to get access to your free Posit Cloud account through the university, please see our Canvas page.

### Git and GitHub

* Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/) using your University of Michigan email address. If you already have a GitHub account tied to another email address, you can [link your UM email address in your account settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
* Sign up for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) for free access to GitHub's Copilot AI programming assistant we will use throughout the course.

## Topics and Materials

* Our main text book is [R for Data Science (2ed)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (R4DS) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garett Grolemund 
* Later in the semester, we will pull additional material from
    * [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) (AdvR)
    * [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) (MS)
* We will learn about using GenAI tools with [AI-Assisted Programming](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog/record/99187979610106381) (AAP) by Tom Taulli.
* For learning git, we will use [Beginning Git and GitHub](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog/record/99187305231206381) (BGG) by
Mariot Tsitoara.
* For statistical background, we suggest [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog/record/99187344801606381) (PSDS)
