## Using Generative AI 

* Artificial intelligence: the use of computer programs to mimic human thinking and reasoning (*models*)
* Machine learning: use of *probabilistic* tools that try to find regular structure in data
* Deep learning: A specific set of algorithms based on very large *neural networks* designed to mimic human brains
* Generative AI: AI tools that are used to *generate new material*, not just answer yes/no questions or produce simple numerical values
* Large language models: Models trained on very large collections of text data that generate text output (usually)

## What Are LLMs good for?

Because we can interact with LLMs by writing *natural language* prompts (rather than code like R), we have a lot of flexibility in how we can use them to support us when we are doing programming.

* Minimizing Search
* Advising Solutions for coding problems
* Interpreting and summarizing existing code
* Generating documentation
* Code integrity

We will use UMGPT for these examples. Later we will introduce GitHub Copilot.

## Search

Recall that R functions can have **optional arguments**. Suppose you do not recall how to write an optional argument? Let's ask UMGPT:

**Prompt**

How do use optional arguments in R?

**Response**

In R, you can use optional arguments in functions by specifying default values for those arguments in the function definition. When a default value is provided, the argument becomes optional because the function can still operate even if the caller does not supply a value for that argument.

Here's a basic example to demonstrate how to use optional arguments in an R function:

```
my_function <- function(x, y = 10, z = 5) {
  result <- x + y + z
  return(result)
}

# Calling the function with all arguments provided
result1 <- my_function(3, 4, 2)  # x = 3, y = 4, z = 2
print(result1)  # Output: 9
```
... continues.

## Advising solutions

Soon we will be learning more about the `ggplot` library for visualizing data sets, but let's seen an example of it in action.

Let's look at the `diamonds` data set that records information on the cut, quality, and price (among other things) on a sample of diamonds.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
diamonds
```

Let's ask UMGPT to help us graph some of these variables.

**Prompt**

Here are a few lines from a data set:

```
> diamonds
# A tibble: 53,940 Ã— 10
   carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z

 ```

Using the ggplot library in R, create a plot that shows the relationships between "carat" and "price" grouped by type of "cut".

**Response**

To show the relationship between "carat" and "price" grouped by type of "cut" using the ggplot2 library in R, you can create a scatter plot and use color or facets to differentiate between the types of "cut". Here are a couple of different approaches to achieve this:

Approach 1: Using color to differentiate "cut"
This approach uses color to distinguish diamonds of different cuts within a single scatter plot.

```
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Use ggplot to create the plot
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Carat (Size) and Price by Cut Type",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price (USD)",
       color = "Cut Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Approach 2: Using facets to split by "cut"
This approach creates separate scatter plots for each type of "cut", organized in a grid.

```
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Use ggplot to create the plot
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ cut) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Carat (Size) and Price by Cut Type",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price (USD)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Approach 3: Combining color and facets
This approach uses color within facets to provide even more visual detail.

```
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Use ggplot to create the plot
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ cut) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Carat (Size) and Price by Cut Type",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price (USD)",
       color = "Cut Type") +
  theme_minimal()
  
```

Explanation of the code: ... trimmed for brevity ...

## Trying Approach 1

Copying and pasting into a code chunk:

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Use ggplot to create the plot
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Carat (Size) and Price by Cut Type",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price (USD)",
       color = "Cut Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Trying the other approaches is left as an exercise.

## Interpreting code and documentation

Research has shown that programmers spend more time *reading* code than *writing* code. Having quality *documentation* is critical to making this easier. LLMs can help make sense of undocumented code and write outlines for documentation.

Example:

```{r}
xyz <- function(x, y, z) {
  
  if (x > 0) {
    return(y)
  } else if (y > 0) {
    return(z)
  }
  
  w <- x^2
  return(w)
}

```

**Prompt**

Explain the code above.


**Result**

Certainly! Let's break down the R function xyz step by step:

Function Definition:

```
xyz <- function(x, y, z) {
```

 line defines a new function named xyz that takes three arguments: x, y, and z.

Check if x is greater than 0:

```
if (x > 0) {
  return(y)
}
```

If the value of x is greater than 0, the function immediately returns the value of y. The function execution stops here if this condition is met.

Check if y is greater than 0 (only if x is not greater than 0):

```
else if (y > 0) {
  return(z)
}
```

If the value of x is not greater than 0, the function then checks if the value of y is greater than 0. If this condition is met, the function returns the value of z. Again, the function execution stops here if this condition is satisfied.

If neither x > 0 nor y > 0:

```
w <- x^2
return(w)
```

If neither of the previous conditions are met (i.e., both x is not greater than 0 and y is not greater than 0), the function calculates the square of x and assigns it to a variable w. Then, it returns the value of w.

Summary:

If x is greater than 0, the function returns y.
If x is not greater than 0 and y is greater than 0, the function returns z.
If neither x > 0 nor y > 0, the function returns the square of x.
This function implements a series of conditional statements to determine what value to return based on the input arguments x, y, and z.

**Prompt (continued)**

Write documentation for this code.

**Result**

Sure, here is a detailed documentation for the xyz function using Roxygen2 style, which is commonly used in R for documenting functions:

```{r}
#' xyz: A function to return y or z based on conditions or the square of x
#'
#' This function takes three arguments: \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{z}.
#' It checks the value of \code{x} and \code{y} to decide which value to return.
#' If \code{x} is greater than 0, it returns \code{y}.
#' If \code{x} is not greater than 0 but \code{y} is greater than 0, it returns \code{z}.
#' If neither \code{x} nor \code{y} is greater than 0, it returns the square of \code{x}.
#'
#' @param x A numeric value.
#' @param y A numeric value.
#' @param z A numeric value.
#'
#' @return A numeric value. If \code{x > 0}, it returns \code{y}. If \code{x <= 0} and \code{y > 0}, it returns \code{z}. 
#'         Otherwise, it returns \code{x} squared.
#'
#' @examples
#' # Example 1: If x is greater than 0
#' xyz(5, 10, 15)
#' # [1] 10
#'
#' # Example 2: If x is not greater than 0 but y is greater than 0
#' xyz(-5, 10, 15)
#' # [1] 15
#'
#' # Example 3: If neither x nor y is greater than 0
#' xyz(-5, -10, 15)
#' # [1] 25
#'
#' @export
xyz <- function(x, y, z) {
  if (x > 0) {
    return(y)
  } else if (y > 0) {
    return(z)
  }
  
  w <- x^2
  return(w)
}
```

... explanation trimmed ...


## Exercise

* Use the help system to find out about the `presidential` data set.
* Open up [UMGPT](https://umgpt.umich.edu/). Write a prompt to help you understand this code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = presidential) + geom_bar(aes(x = party))
```
* Use UMGPT to help you create a plot that shows how long each president served in years. Make sure the output is ordered by when the president served.

Here is an R session you can use to test your results:

```{r umgpt-exercise, exercise = TRUE}

```


## Result from UMGPT

Copying and pasting the prompt from the previous page resulted in:
```{r}
# Calculate the duration in years
presidential <- presidential %>%
  mutate(duration_years = as.numeric(difftime(end, start, units = "days") / 365.25))

# Create the plot
ggplot(presidential, aes(x = start, y = duration_years, fill = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Duration of Each President's Term",
       x = "Term Start Date",
       y = "Duration in Years") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("Democratic" = "blue", "Republican" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "4 years")
```

Not a bad solution, but I wanted the president's names on the x-axis. Can we improve it?

**Prompt**

**Result**

```{r}
# Calculate the duration in years
presidential <- presidential %>%
  mutate(duration_years = as.numeric(difftime(end, start, units = "days") / 365.25))

# Create the plot
ggplot(presidential, aes(x = reorder(name, start), y = duration_years, fill = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Duration of Each President's Term",
       x = "President",
       y = "Duration in Years") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Democratic" = "blue", "Republican" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

But wait! How did "Bush" serve twelve years?!

**Lesson**: Always check the results when using AI-generated code.

## A programming specific LLM

UMGPT and other general LLMs are often quite good at working with code, but for a more focused approach, we will use GitHub's Copilot.

* Trained on open source software projects hosted on GitHub
* Integrates with IDEs, including RStudio/Posit Cloud
* Free with GitHub Education (paid services also available)

## Getting Started

Connecting Copilot to your Posit Cloud project is not hard, but *you must connect each new project* you start.

![Select "Global Options"](images/copilot_global_opts.png)

![Install Copilot Extension](images/copilot_install.png)

![Sign in and get code](images/copilot_signin.png)

![Use the new window to enter code](images/copilot_enter_code.png)

<!-- TODO: Create a project that students can use for some examples -->

Open up the "Example HW" project and connect it to Copilot.

## Interacting with Copilot

Copilot will now be running in your project.

When you open a .Rmd or .R file, Copilot will make suggestions in gray text. Hit "Tab" to accept them. Hit "enter" or keep typing to ignore them.

You can use Copilot with both the markdown and R code chunks, but I find it works best in the R chunks.

## Copilot in R code

Using comments (`#` lines) we can instruct Copilot what we want it to do. For example,

```{r}
# write a function to compute the geometric mean of a set of values
```

This generated

```{r}
geometric_mean <- function(x) {
  n <- length(x)
  prod(x)^(1/n)
}

# test the function
geometric_mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) # 2.605171
```


## Exercise

Using the `Example HW` project where we enabled Copilot, open `Example_HW.Rmd`.

Create a new code chunk. Use Copilot to create a graph based on the `diamonds` data set.

## Giving cues to Copilot

While Copilot can often just build off your comments, a few hints can be helpful.

1. Write multiple line comments with more directions.
2. Write "# prompt:" to differentiate this from other comments.
3. If you have a question you can write:

```{r}
# q: What are the arguments to the ggplot function? 
```
Hit enter, and Copilot responds:
```{r}
# a: The arguments to the ggplot function are data and aesthetics (aes).
```

* The space between the `#` and `q:` is important.
* Sometimes you need to add the `# a:` prompt to get Copilot to give you an answer.

## Exercise

Copy this function into a new code chunk in `Example_HW.Rmd`. Use the question and answer feature to find out what it does. 
```{r}
xyz <- function(x, y, z) {
  rep(x, y) |> paste(collapse = z)
}
```

## My results

These can vary for individual sessions, but this is what I got:

```{r}
xyz <- function(x, y, z) {
  rep(x, y) |> paste(collapse = z)
}

# q: what does the function xyz do?
# a: The function xyz repeats the string x y times and concatenates them with the string z.

xyz("hello", 3, " ")
```

## Copilot Workflow

1. Write a comment with a prompt.
2. Hit enter to get Copilot's response.
3. Accept the response by hitting "Tab" or keep typing to ignore it.
4. Test the result to make sure it works as expected.

## Exercise

Use Copilot to create a function that computes the median absolute deviation of a collection of numbers (R calls this a vector). MAD is defined as:

$$\text{MAD}(X) = \text{median}(|X - \text{median}(X)|)$$

Verify your function works by computing the median absolute deviation of the values 1 to 5. The MAD should be 1. Here is a little code to get you started:

```{r}
x <- 1:5
```

Note: Copilot will try to tell you the output of the function you just wrote. This can be helpful, but it is not always correct. Verify it yourself by running the chunk in the Console by pressing "Ctrl + Shift + Enter" or "Cmd + Shift + Enter".

## My Results

```{r}
# write a function to compute the median absolute deviation of a set of values
median_abs_dev <- function(x) {
  median(abs(x - median(x)))
}

# apply the median_abs_dev function to x
x <- 1:5
median_abs_dev(x) # 1

```

## Using Copilot to help you diagnose problems (debugging)

When we write code (or use Copilot to do it), we will encounter errors. Copilot can help us diagnose these errors.

For example, if we write:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# write a function to compute the median absolute deviation of a set of values
median_abs_dev <- function(x) {
  median(abs(x - median(x))
}
```

When we run this chunk we will get the error:

```
Error: unexpected '}' in:
"  median(abs(x - median(x))
}"
```

If we ask Copilot what the error is, it will tell us (real q/a interaction with Copilot):


```{r}
# q: What is the error in the median_abs_dev function?
# a: The error in the median_abs_dev function is an unexpected '}'.

# q: where is the error in the median_abs_dev function?
# a: The error in the median_abs_dev function is on line 3.

# q: how can I fix this error?
# a: You can fix this error by adding a closing parenthesis to the median function.

# q: rewrite the function to fix the error
# a: median_abs_dev <- function(x) {
#   median(abs(x - median(x)))
# }
```

This doesn't always work, but often we can get good information on what is going on.

## Exercise

Copy the following code into a new code chunk in `Example_HW.Rmd`. Use Copilot to help you diagnose the error.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
xyz <- function(x, y) {
  ratio <- (x + y) / z
  return(ratio)
}

xyz(12, 10)
```

## My results

```{r, eval = FALSE}

xyz <- function(x, y) {
  ratio <- (x + y) / z
  return(ratio)
}

xyz(12, 10)
# I copied the next line in:
# Error in xyz(12, 10) : object 'z' not found

# q: What does this error mean?
# a: The error "object 'z' not found" means that the variable z is not defined in the function.

# q: how can I fix this error?
# a: You can fix this error by defining the variable z in the function.

# q: how do I do that?
# a: You can define the variable z by adding it as an argument to the function.
```

```{r}
# rewrite the function with the z argument added
xyz <- function(x, y, z) {
  ratio <- (x + y) / z
  return(ratio)
}

xyz(12, 10, 2)
```

In this case, if you want to run the entire chunk, you need to remove or comment out the line `xyz(12, 10)`. Or you can use "Ctrl + Enter" or "Cmd + Enter" to run lines one at a time.


## Introduction to R

Let's learn some R!

At many times, you will have access to small windows where you can write R code. Here's an example. Run the code to see what you get!

```{r intro-r, exercise = TRUE}
# number of sunspots per year in a more convenient format
sunspots_year <- tibble(year = as.numeric(time(sunspot.year)),
                        spots = as.numeric(sunspot.year))

# what years are covered?
range(sunspots_year$year)

# plot the number of spots for each year in the data set
ggplot(sunspots_year, aes(x = year, y = spots)) + geom_line()
```

## R Packages

- Use the install.packages("<PACKAGE NAME>") command to install packages in R
- To load a package (already installed) use the library(<PACKAGE NAME>) command

```{r package1}
library(learnr)            
library(tidyverse)            
```
- You can load lots of packages together as library(<PACKAGE1>, <PACKAGE2>, <PACKAGE3>)

```{r package2}
library(learnr, tidyverse)
```

## Assignment and Operations

- The standard form of an assignment is <OBJECT_NAME> <- <OBJECT_VALUE>
- The form <OBJECT_NAME> = <OBJECT_VALUE> also works, but R's community prefers <- notation
- A name can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dots but should start with a letter

```{r assignment}
#variable assignments
u <- 3              ## this is considered standard
v = -2              ## this is accepted
x <- 6
y <- 'hello world'  ## 'hello world' is a string
y <- "hello world"  ## also double quotes
z <- TRUE           ## boolean variable (also T/F can be used for TRUE/FALSE but not True/False) 

#Few examples of operation
u + x
x/v
```

Exercise 1:

- add x and y
- add x and z

What do you observe?

```{r exercise1, exercise = TRUE}
x <- 6
y <- "hello world"  ## also double quotes
z <- TRUE    

# your code here
```

## Coding Style

Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread. 

(picked this statement from: https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html)

Please try to follow the recommended coding style right from get go!


## Function Calls

We can use '?' to look up documentation of functions

```{r lookup, exercise = TRUE}
?sqrt 
sqrt(5)
```

```{r log}
log(100)  # natural log
log(100, base = 10) # log with base 10
```

```{r round}
round(3.1415926535, 3)
abs(-4)
```


Exercise 2: Look up the help documentation for the `mean` function. For the "default s3 method" (we'll talk more about methods later), what arguments are required? What are the optional arguments?

Use the `mean` function to calculate the average value of the vector `x` below. Also calculate a trimmed mean where the top and bottom 10% of the values are removed.

```{r exercise2, exercise = TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```


## Collections

Since R is a **statistical programming language**, working with collections of data is fundamental to the language.

- The vector is the basic data structure in R. All components must be the same type (e.g. numeric, string, logical, etc). This property is sometimes referred to as being "atomic."
- Lists can contain different types of data.

```{r atomicvec}
int_vec <- c(2L, 3L, 5L, 8L) # Make an atomic vector containing integers
fp_vec <- c(-0.3, 16.7, 58.9) # Make an atomic vector containing floating point numbers
string_vec <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry") # Make an atomic vector containing strings
logical_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) # Make an atomic vector containing logical values

# Describe the structures of the atomic vectors
str(int_vec)
str(fp_vec)
str(string_vec)
str(logical_vec)
```

We can also make a list of vectors of different types:
```{r list}
my_list <- list(int_vec, fp_vec, string_vec, logical_vec) # Make a list
str(my_list) # Describe the structure of the list
```

We can name the components of a vector or a list.
```{r vecname}
# Components can be named
named_string_vec <- c(fruit1 = "apple", fruit2 = "banana", fruit3 = "cherry")
named_list <- list(the_int_vec = int_vec, the_string_vec = named_string_vec)
```

```{r output-vec}
named_string_vec
```

```{r output-list2}
named_list
```

### Subsetting

- Subsetting refers to extracting parts of an object
- Several ways to subset a vector
  + [] usually used on atomic vectors
     + Can extract multiple components
  + [[]] usually used on lists
     + Can only extract one component
  + $ used on lists
     + Can only extract one component, by name
     
```{r extrac}
string_vec[2] # Extract second component
string_vec[c(2, 3)] # Extract second and third components - note the use of c()!
c(2, 3)
string_vec[-1] # Extract all but the first component
string_vec[-c(1, 3)] # Extract all but the first and third components
string_vec[4]
string_vec[-4]

```

```{r extract2}
my_list[[1]] # Extract first component
named_list$the_int_vec # Extract component named "the_int_vec"
str(my_list[1]) # if you use [] on a list, the result is a sub-list
```

## Logical Operators
- Negation:
```{r negation}
a = TRUE
b = c(TRUE, FALSE)

!a      ## use '!' for negation (not) in R
!b
```

- Comparison:
```{r comparison}
x = c(1, 3, 5)
y = c(2, 3, 4)

x == y   ## element-wise equality
x != y   ## what does this do?
x > y    ## greater than
x >= y   ## greater than or equal to
```

- 'and' and 'or'

```{r and-or}
(5 > 2) | (1 == 0) 
(5 > 2) & (1 == 0) 

c = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
d = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
c & d
c | d

all(c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE))
all(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))

any(c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))
any(c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))
```

Useful: More about base R can be found here: [base R cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/base-r.pdf)


## Working with Data


## `data.frame`: lists of vectors

We organize our **samples** of $n$ **units/subjects/participants** on whom we have measured **variables** into a **tables.**

- The units are on the rows ($n$ rows)
- The variables are the columns ($k$ columns)

Tables are orgranized as **lists** of length $k$ composed of vectors of length $n$.

Each variable is a vector that we can operate on.

### Creating a Tibble

Tibble construction syntax is as follows:

```
dataframe = tibble(
  col_name1 = c(some_vector),
  col_name2 = c(some other vector)
)
```

We can construct a tibble:
```{r tibble}
# (These are characters from Avatar: the Last Airbender)
dat = tibble(
  name = c('Aang', 'Katara', 'Sokka', 'Toph', 'Zuko'), 
  age = c(112, 14, 15, 12, 16), 
  is_bender = c(T, T, F, T, T),
  nationality = c("Air", "Water", "Water", "Earth", "Fire"),
  grade = c(89, 94, 96, 86, 82),
  extra_credit = rep(1, 5) 
)

dat
```

We can extract elements from a tibble:
```{r tibble-extract}
dat[2,] # accessing a row
dat[4, 4] #accessing a single value
# syntax is: [row, column]
dat[, 5]
dat[2:3, c(1, 3, 4)]
```

We can also use $ to access a single column:
```{r dollarsign}
dat$name # accessing a single column
dat$grade
```

We can also create a new column:

```{r newcolumn}
dat$final_score = dat$grade + dat$extra_credit
print(dat)
# a dataframe (tibble) is a list of vectors (of the same length)
```

Logical operations on tibbles:
```{r tibblelogic}
subset(dat, age < 100) # subset based on logical condition
```

Exercise 3: Take a subset of Avatar characters who are benders and have a raw grade greater than 90%. Save this to a variable called `dat2`.

```{r exercise3, exercise = TRUE}
dat = tibble(
  name = c('Aang', 'Katara', 'Sokka', 'Toph', 'Zuko'), 
  age = c(112, 14, 15, 12, 16), 
  is_bender = c(T, T, F, T, T),
  nationality = c("Air", "Water", "Water", "Earth", "Fire"),
  grade = c(89, 94, 96, 86, 82),
  extra_credit = rep(1, 5) 
)

### A Large Dataset

`diamonds` is a dataset in package ggplot2:

```{r diamond}
head(diamonds)
dim(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```

You can use `?diamonds` to check the meaning of each variables.

## Plotting with ggplot2

Every ggplot2 plot has three key components:

- data

- A set of aesthetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, and

- At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a geom function.

(Source: https://ggplot2-book.org/getting-started.html)

ggplot is a layer-based function. We first create a coordinate system that you can add layers to using the function ggplot(data = ...). This will creates an empty graph.

```{r step1}
ggplot(data = diamonds)
```

We then add the data points onto this empty graph using the function `geom_point()`. The argument `mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)` tells R what variables (columns in diamonds) we want to plot on each axis.

```{r step2}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

It would be helpful to also visualize the color of diamonds in the scatter plot. We can study this more in depth by making a third variable and map to some aesthetic (i.e., visual property) of the points. Some examples are color, shape, size, and transparency.

```{r step3}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
    # carat on x-axis, price on y-axis, color represents different colors of the diamonds
    # alpha is the transparency of the points
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color), alpha = 0.7)
```

Then we can add axes labels and title 

```{r step4}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color), alpha = 0.7) +
    # specify axis labels
    labs(x = 'Carats', y = 'Price($)', title = 'Diamond price by carat count') 
```

You can get a better background by changing the theme. You can find more information about ggplot [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html).

```{r step5}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color), alpha=0.7) +
    # specify axis labels
    labs(x = 'Carats', y = 'Price($)') + 

    # another way of specifying title
    ggtitle('Diamond price by carat count') +
  theme_bw()
```

You can also create subplots for different cut types by using `facet_wrap()`:

```{r facet}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color), alpha = 0.7) +
    facet_wrap(~cut, ncol = 3) +
    labs(x = 'Carats', y = 'Price($)') + 
    ggtitle('Diamond price by carat count') +
  theme_bw()
```

Exercise 4: Recreate the box-plot below 

*hint you need to use `geom_boxplot`*
